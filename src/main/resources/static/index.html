                <p>As current teaching assistants we noticed that while there are resources provided by 
                  schools like free tutoring and office hours, there are multiple students with many time commitments and conflicting
                  events that prevent them from taking advantage of these resources that would help them academically. Tutor Bridge is 
                   aimed to solve this by connecting tutors with flexible schedules to students in order to accommodate to their needs.</p>
